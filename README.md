# poembot
A Markov chain bot that writes then tweets poems based on the complete
works of Emily Dickinson.

This project follows after github.timothybeal/kjvbot, and is easily 
adaptable to other corpora and formats (e.g., different poetry collections,
different numbers of lines and characters, different start words, etc.).

Many thanks to Jason Barber and Michael Hemenway for all the real work.
